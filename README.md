# Semantic Skills-based Resume Screening System

## Overview

Semantic Skills-based Resume Screening System is an AI/NLP-assisted recruitment screening project. The system is designed to compare resumes with job descriptions through skills, evidence, experience, seniority, domain fit, and explainable review cards.

The project does not train a recruitment model from scratch. The MVP starts with rule-based processing, skill taxonomy, skill normalization, matching rules, evidence scoring, and explainable ranking. Semantic embedding can be added in a later phase after the rule-based baseline is stable.

## Current Phase

The project is currently in:

```text
Phase 02 - Document Loader and Text Input
```

This phase adds the first pipeline module: reading `.txt` files for JD and CV inputs. Resume parsing, skill extraction, matching, evidence detection, scoring, and review card generation will be implemented in later phases.

## Planned Processing Flow

```text
CV / JD text
  -> Document Loader
  -> Parser
  -> Skill Extraction
  -> Skill Normalization
  -> Skill Matching
  -> Evidence Detection
  -> Scoring
  -> Ranking
  -> Explainable Review Card
```

## Implemented Scope

Included:

- Repository foundation.
- Minimal CLI entry point.
- Minimal Streamlit entry point.
- Directory structure for data, source code, tests, outputs, and docs.
- Development learning log.
- TXT document loader.
- Minimal demo JD and CV text files.
- Unit tests for document loading.

Not included yet:

- Resume/JD parsing.
- Skill taxonomy content.
- Skill matching.
- Evidence detection.
- Scoring and ranking.
- Review card generation.
- Full Streamlit UI.

## Run Minimal CLI

```bash
python main.py --help
python main.py
```

Expected behavior in Phase 02: the command confirms that the foundation is ready. The document loader is tested separately and is not wired into the CLI flow yet.

## Run Document Loader Tests

```bash
pytest
```

Manual loader check:

```bash
python -c "from src.document_loader import load_text_file; print(load_text_file('data/jobs/jd_backend_java.txt'))"
```

## Run Minimal Streamlit Entry Point

Install dependencies first:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

In Phase 02, the app still shows a placeholder page because the functional UI is planned for a later phase.

## Development Workflow

Work is organized by phase. Each phase should have:

- A branch named `phase/<number>-<short-name>`.
- A phase plan in `docs/phases/`.
- A development learning log entry in `docs/dev-learning-log.md`.
- A refactoring plan in `docs/refactoring/` after implementation.
- Manual testing notes before moving to the next phase.

## Next Phase

The next planned phase is:

```text
Phase 03 - Resume Parser and JD Parser
```

That phase will parse raw text into structured resume profiles and job criteria.
